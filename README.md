Control Alg is pretty much completed
It's very fast, however, it is very inefficient due to the randomness
I think its so fast because the various dictionary checks are all just O(1) 


Better control is an algorithm that was unplanned. I was just thinking that instead of randomly picking, I would scan through all the possible pairs and on average it's faster and takes fewer weeks than control. Better control 2 is better control 1, but it removes invalid guesses from the list of possible pairds and the recursively calls the function with the new list. Unfortunetly, it doesn't really work- it takes longer and more weeks and adds like mutliple duplicates to the answer list.

Best case isn't too functional at the moment. I'm working on generating all 16! pairs.
